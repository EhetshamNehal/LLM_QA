The Timekeeper's Pocket Watch

In the heart of a bustling city, there lived a clockmaker named Oliver who owned a mysterious pocket watch.
This watch had the power to stop time for a single minute. 
One day, while fixing the city's grand clock tower, Oliver dropped the pocket watch. 
As it shattered on the ground, time froze throughout the city. 
Panicked, Oliver gathered the pieces and managed to reassemble the watch, but when he tried to use it, 
something was different. 
 
Time didn't stop for a minute; instead, it moved backward, undoing the events of the day. 
Oliver soon realized that the watch allowed him to correct mistakes, make amends, and cherish every moment. 
With its newfound power, he brought the city closer together, one reset moment at a time.
